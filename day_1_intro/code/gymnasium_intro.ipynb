    "Gymnasium can be used with Python to create state, action, next state, reward envrionments. For example if you consider the game of chess, the state at time t would be the position of all chess pieces, the action would be your next move, the state would change (chess pieces move) and a reward would be zero untill you win (+1) or loose (-1). \n",
